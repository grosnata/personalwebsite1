            <h3>Weekend Trips</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="intro1">
            <p>Throughout the entirety of the 8 weeks, my group and I were able to go on three main trips. We went to the High Coast - Northern Sweden (about 5 hours north of Stockholm), Copenhagen (Denmark), and Tallinn (Estonia) </p>

            <h4>High Coast, Sweden</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="coast text-block">
            <p>Our first trip was to the High Coast in Sweden. This part of Sweden is about 5 hours north of Stockholm, located on the Gulf of Bothnia. Here, we went "glamping" in huts and went on numerous beautiful hikes. It was a relaxing trip where we were able to take in and appreciate the country side of Sweden.</p>

      <div class="copenhagen text-block">
            <p>On our second trip, we visited Copenhagen, Denmark. On this trip, we stayed in a hostel located in the heart of the city. We spent our days exploring well-known landmarks and exploring delicious restaurants. My favorite part of Copenhagen was Nyhavn - the waterfront canal lined with brightly colored buildings. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="tallinn text-block">
            <p>Our final weekend trip was to Tallinn, Estonia. This trip was unique because Tallinn is located in Eastern Europe, not Central Europe as we were used to. It was interesting to see the blend of Central Europe and the Soviet Union. I really enjoyed seeing the beautiful architecture, specifically Alexander Nevsky Cathedral and the Kadriog Art Museum. </p>
